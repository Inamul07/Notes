										MIHgram(Instagram-Clone) using React & Firebase
1.) Installed react modules
		npx create-react-app mihgram
2.) Installed firebase tools (and completed setting-up the App)
		npm install -g firebase-tools
3.) Started the server in port 3000 in the react folder(i.e mihgram)
		$ cd mihgram
		$ npm start
4.) Deleted unwanted files (like logo.png)

			className="app_headerImage"
			src="https://www.instagram.com/static/images/web/mobile_nav_type_logo.png/735145cfe0a4.png"
			alt="" 
		/>
6.) When resizing the window to avoid extending the image we need to maintain the aspect ratio
		object-fit:contain; (in CSS)
7.) Added aheader for the logo
8.) Now created post.js and post.css to create posts
	* Remember to seperate components as much as possible
